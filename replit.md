## CMS (Content Management System)

Located at `artifacts/cms/`, served at `/cms`. Admin interface for managing all platform content. Login: `admin` / `1234` (default, overridable via `CMS_USERNAME`/`CMS_PIN` env vars).

Design aligned with main site: "THE TRIBUNAL." branding with crimson period, Playfair Display headings, Barlow Condensed uppercase labels, sharp corners (radius: .125rem), muted-foreground at 63% lightness, dark-only theme.

Sidebar sections:
- **Overview**: Dashboard (content stats + recent activity), Analytics (vote analytics, top polls, votes by category/country, daily activity), Homepage Manager (masthead, ticker, sections, banners, newsletter CTA)
- **Content**: Debates (CRUD + editorial workflow + vote options), Predictions (CRUD + resolution dates + momentum), Pulse (DB-backed topics with CRUD, spark data, editorial status), Voices (CRUD + full profile editor), Ideation Engine (AI-powered content generation with 5-step agentic workflow)
- **Pages**: About (hero, pillars, beliefs, founder statement, region coverage editor), FAQ (sections + Q&A editor), Terms (sections editor with last-updated date), Contact (emails, social links, office location), Debates Page (hero, ticker, sort labels, empty state), Predictions Page (hero, ticker, categories, featured IDs), Voices Page (hero, impact statements, stats bar, filter labels), Polls Page (hero, ticker items, ticker source), Apply Page (hero, criteria, countries, sectors, success message, disclaimer)
- **Settings**: Site Settings (navigation links, CTA button, footer links, social links, SEO/meta, cookie consent, share gate copy)
- **Design**: Design Tokens (brand colors, UI colors, typography — all DB-backed)
- **Audience**: Subscribers (newsletter list from DB, search, CSV export), Applications ("Join The Voices" submissions from DB, review/approve/reject/shortlist)

All CMS content endpoints are backed by real PostgreSQL queries via Drizzle ORM:
- **Debates** (`/api/cms/debates`): Queries `pollsTable` + `pollOptionsTable` — 422 polls with full CRUD, status transitions, and vote counts
- **Voices** (`/api/cms/voices`): Queries `profilesTable` — 103 profiles with full CRUD (no editorial_status column in DB; all treated as "approved")
- **Predictions** (`/api/cms/predictions`): Queries `predictionsTable` — 230 predictions with full CRUD, editorial status, momentum tracking
- **Pulse Topics** (`/api/cms/pulse-topics`): Queries `pulseTopicsTable` — 56 topics with full CRUD, spark data, editorial status
- **Design Tokens** (`/api/cms/design-tokens`): Queries `designTokensTable` — 13 tokens with full CRUD (brand colors, UI colors, typography)
- **Page Configs** (`/api/cms/pages/:page`): Queries `cmsConfigsTable` — about, pulse, polls, apply, faq, terms, contact, debates_page, predictions_page, voices_page
- **Site Settings** (`/api/cms/site-settings`): GET + PUT for global navigation, footer, SEO, cookie consent, share gate config
- **Stats** (`/api/cms/stats`): Real DB counts for debates/voices/predictions
- **Taxonomy** (`/api/cms/taxonomy`): Categories, tags, sectors, countries, cities all derived from real DB data
- **Subscribers** (`/api/cms/subscribers`, `/export`): Real DB queries on `newsletterSubscribersTable`
- **Applications** (`/api/cms/applications`): Real DB queries on `hustlerApplicationsTable`
- **Analytics** (`/api/cms/analytics`): Real DB aggregations across votes, polls, profiles, subscribers
- **Ideation Engine** (`/api/cms/ideation/*`): AI-powered content generation with sessions, ideas, exclusion list, prompt templates, rejection log. Uses Claude (Anthropic) for generation/safety/refinement and Perplexity for research. Falls back to intelligent mock data when API keys are not configured. DB tables: `ideation_sessions`, `ideation_ideas`, `ideation_rejection_log`, `ideation_exclusion_list`, `ideation_prompt_templates` (schema in `lib/db/src/schema/ideation.ts`). AI service abstraction in `artifacts/api-server/src/services/ideation-ai.ts`

## Features

### Insight & Engagement Layer
- **Personal Insight Card** — after unlocking results, shows a contextual insight based on vote % and how divided the question is
- **Enhanced Voter Profile** (`localStorage tmh_voter`) — tracks total votes, streak, categories, pollsVoted, firstVoteAt; updates on every vote
- **Vote counter badge** — Navbar shows live vote count with streak flame icon; hover tooltip shows category breakdown
- **"Weigh in" / "Voted" indicators** — poll card left panel shows voting status; bottom bar shows "You voted: [option] · X,XXX total"
- **Share icon fix** — robust clipboard copy with `execCommand` fallback + URL tooltip if clipboard unavailable
- **Weekly streak** — consecutive day voting tracked; "3-day streak 🔥" shown in results phase
- **First-time welcome** — one-time message on first vote: "Welcome to TMH. You just joined X,XXX people…"
- **Live activity feed** — homepage shows anonymized "Someone from UAE just voted on '…'" cycling every 4s from `/api/activity`
- **Platform stats bar** — live homepage stats strip: total votes, live debates, countries, active this week
- **Personalized hero subhead** — once user has voted, changes to "You've cast X votes. Y total across the region"
- **Country breakdown enhanced** — shows top voted option per country ("Most voted: 'Option text'")
- **Cross-sell filter** — related polls on `/polls/[id]` prioritize unvoted polls; shows "You've voted on X of Y in [Category]"

### Admin
- **Admin page** (`/admin`) — password-gated (key: `tmh-admin-2026` / `ADMIN_KEY` env var); application queue with AI scores, editorial approval/decline, notes; create polls with featured toggle; live stats dashboard
- **Admin API** (`/api/admin/*`) — requires `x-admin-key` header; endpoints: `GET /applications`, `PATCH /applications/:id`, `GET /stats`, `POST /polls`

### Editorial Gate
- **`editorialStatus`** column on `polls` table: `"approved"` (default), `"draft"`, `"rejected"`
- All public API endpoints filter by `editorialStatus = 'approved'`
- Admin can toggle status via `PATCH /api/admin/polls/:id/editorial`
- New polls created via admin are auto-approved

### Integrations (env-variable gated)
- **Resend** (`RESEND_API_KEY`) — sends confirmation email on Voice application
- **Beehiiv** (`BEEHIIV_API_KEY` + `BEEHIIV_PUBLICATION_ID`) — syncs newsletter subscribers on subscribe
- **Admin key** (`ADMIN_KEY`) — defaults to `"tmh-admin-2026"` if not set

### Pages
- **Home** (`/`) — WSJ-style editorial front page: masthead → mixed ticker (debates+predictions+pulse with colored badges) → 4-column section hooks (Debates/Predictions/The Pulse/Voices) → lead debate column + latest debates sidebar → featured prediction with inline YES/NO voting (localStorage-persisted, share gate with WhatsApp/X/LinkedIn/Telegram/email unlock) + prediction sidebar with quick Y/N vote buttons and share icons → featured pulse card with share + "Explore →" link + pulse sidebar with share icons → The Voices → topics → newsletter CTA. All sections have share functionality (ShareMenu component with native share API fallback to clipboard). Prediction votes persist in `localStorage` as `tmh_pred_{id}`. Share gate pattern matches debates: vote → share/email to unlock → see results.

Only inserts if keys don't exist. Requires DB schema to be pushed first (`pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push`).
